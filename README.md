# team-generator

## Description

This application uses CLI, powered by javaScript and Node.js, to generate a web page based on the input of the user. Primarly designed for software development managers to organize team members on a single page for any given project.

Upon launching the application, the manager is asked for their name, employee ID number, email address, and office numer. The manager is subsquently able to choose how many, if any, additional employees they would like to add to the team.

The user may choose to add engineers and/or interns to the team. The prompts following the selection of adding a new engineer or intern will differ based on the role that was selected. The user may add as many employees as they like; however, the page is not designed for large teams. Future development may allow for large teams of 8+ people to display in a cleaner fashion. Still, functionally, any number of employees can be added.

Once the user has decided not to add any additional team members, an html page will be created, which will display all team members and their information exclusive to their role.
